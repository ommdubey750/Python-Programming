'''Practice Problem: Write a program to find how many times the substring “Emma” appears in a given string.

Exercise Purpose: Text analysis and pattern matching are core pillars of programming. This exercise introduces searching for a “needle in a haystack,” a fundamental concept for building search engines or data validation tools.

Given Input:

str_x = "Emma is good developer. Emma is a writer"
Expected Output: Emma appeared 2 times'''
def Function():
    count=0
    for i in words:
        if i==word:
            count+=1
    print(f"Emma appeared {count} Times")
str_x="Emma is good developer. Emma is a write"
words=str_x.split()
word='Emma'
Function()
