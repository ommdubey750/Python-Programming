'''Practice Problem: Write a function called exponent(base, exp) that returns an integer value of the base raised to the power of the exponent.

Exercise Purpose: Learn about “Accumulator Patterns.” Although Python has a built-in power operator (**), making your own version shows how repeated multiplication works and how functions return results to the main program.

Given Input: base = 2, exp = 5

Expected Output: 2 raises to the power of 5: 32
'''
def Func():
    power=base**exp
    print(power)
base=int(input("Enter the Base : "))
exp=int(input("Enter the Exp : "))
Func()
