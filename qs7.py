'''Practice Problem: Create a list of 5 fruits. Add a new fruit to the end of the list, then remove the second fruit (at index 1).

Exercise Purpose: This exercise teaches “Dynamic Collection Management.” Lists are rarely static; being able to modify, expand, and prune them is essential for handling data like shopping carts, user lists, or inventory systems.

Given Input: fruits = ["apple", "banana", "cherry", "date", "elderberry"]

Expected Output: ['apple', 'cherry', 'date', 'elderberry', 'fig']

'''
fruits=["apple","Banana","cherry","date","elderberry"]
print("Before Add and Remove : ",fruits)
n=input("Enter the Fruite : ")
fruits.append(n)
fruits.remove(fruits[1])
print("After Add and Remove :",fruits)
