'''Practice Problem: Iterate through a given list of numbers and print only those numbers which are divisible by 5.

Exercise Purpose: This exercise teaches the use of the modulo operator (%) and loop filtering. In data processing, you often need to sift through large datasets to extract subsets that meet mathematical criteria.


num_list = [10, 20, 33, 46, 55]'''
def Divisible():
    print("Divisible by 5 : ")
    for i in num_list:
        if i%5==0:
            print(i,end=" ")
num_list=[10,20,33,46,55]
Divisible()
